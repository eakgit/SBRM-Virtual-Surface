%% BÃ©zier Curves and Kronecker's Tensor Product
% Last time we talked about Martin Newell's famous teapot. Today we're 
% going to talk about the curves which the teapot is made of. These are 
% known as <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve BÃ©zier curves>.
% These are extremely useful curves, and you'll encounter them in lots of 
% different places in computer graphics.
%
% Let's look at how to draw a BÃ©zier curve. We'll start by drawing a line 
% the hard way. We'll start with these two points.
p1x = input("Enter the x coordinate of p1: ");
p1y = input("Enter the y coordinate of p1: ");
p2x = input("Enter the x coordinate of p2: ");
p2y = input("Enter the y coordinate of p2: ");
p3x = input("Enter the x coordinate of p3: ");
p3y = input("Enter the y coordinate of p3: ");
p4x = input("Enter the x coordinate of p4: ");
p4y = input("Enter the y coordinate of p4: ");


pt1 = [ p1x;p1y];
pt2 = [p2x; p2y];

%%
% We'll use this simple function to label the points.
type placelabel

%%
% And we'll use 'axis equal' to make the scaling uniform in the X & Y 
% directions.
placelabel(pt1,'pt_1');
placelabel(pt2,'pt_2');
xlim([0 50])
axis equal

%%
% Now we want to draw the line segment between them. We can think of this 
% line as being a linear combination of the two points. 
%
% $$0<=t<=1$$
%
% $$pt(t) = (1-t)*pt_1 + t*pt_2$$
%
% When $t$ is equal to 0, we get:
%
% $$pt(0) = (1-0)*pt_1 + 0*pt_2$$
%
% which is equal to $pt1$. When $t$ is equal to 1, we get:
%
% $$pt(1) = (1-1)*pt_1 + 1*pt_2$$
%
% which is equal to $pt2$. When $t$ is equal to 1/2, we get:
%
% $$pt(1/2) = (1-1/2)*pt_1 + 1/2*pt_2$$
%
% which is the midpoint of the line segment. And indeed, for any value of $t$
% between 0 and 1, we get a point on the line. 
%
% There are a couple of ways to implement this in MATLAB, but we'll do it 
% the following way. The <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/kron.html kron> function will give us the <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product Kronecker tensor 
% product> of two arrays. This means that it will give us all of the
% possible products of the elements in those two arrays. So, for example, 
% if we create an array of t values like this:
t = linspace(0,1,101);

%%
% We can use kron to multiply all of them by the two coordinate values in 
% each point like this:
pts = kron((1-t),pt1) + kron(t,pt2);

%%
% And then we can plot them.
hold on
plot(pts(1,:),pts(2,:))
hold off

%% 
% and voila! We have drawn the line between the points.
%
% So why do we want to do this? Wouldn't it be easier to just use the line
% command?
cla
line([pt1(1), pt2(1)],[pt1(2), pt2(2)])

%%
% The reason is that we're going to expand this to more points and
% higher-order functions of $t$.  Instead of linear combinations of two 
% points, we're going to create higher-order combinations of three or four 
% points.
%
% We'll start with the quadratic BÃ©zier curve. This curve takes three points.
%
pt1 = [ 5;-10];
pt2 = [18; 18];
pt3 = [45; 15];

cla
placelabel(pt1,'pt_1');
placelabel(pt2,'pt_2');
placelabel(pt3,'pt_3');
xlim([0 50])
axis equal

%%
% And we've still got $t$ going from 0 to 1, but we'll use second-order
% polynomials like this:
%
% $$pt(t) = (1-t)^2*pt_1 + 2 (1-t) t*pt_2 + t^2*pt_3$$
%
% These are known as the <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_polynomial
% Bernstein basis polynomials>.
%
% We can use the kron function to evaluate them, just as we did in the 
% linear case.
pts = kron((1-t).^2,pt1) + kron(2*(1-t).*t,pt2) + kron(t.^2,pt3);

hold on
plot(pts(1,:),pts(2,:))
hold off

%%
% Notice that the resulting curve starts at $pt1$ and ends at $pt3$. In
% between, it moves towards, but doesn't reach, $pt2$. 


%%
% Next we can go up to the cubic BÃ©zier. This is the one which the teapot 
% uses. We'll need 4 points ...
pt1 = [ 5;-10];
pt2 = [18; 18];
pt3 = [38; -5];
pt4 = [45; 15];

cla
placelabel(pt1,'pt_1');
placelabel(pt2,'pt_2');
placelabel(pt3,'pt_3');
placelabel(pt4,'pt_4');
xlim([0 50])
axis equal

%%
% ... and the following third-order equation:
%
% $$pt(t) = (1-t)^3*pt_1 + 3 (1-t)^2 t*pt_2 + 3 (1-t) t^2*pt_3 + t^3*pt_4$$
%
pts = kron((1-t).^3,pt1) + kron(3*(1-t).^2.*t,pt2) + kron(3*(1-t).*t.^2,pt3) + kron(t.^3,pt4);

hold on
plot(pts(1,:),pts(2,:))
hold off

%%
% Again we can see that the curve starts at the first point and ends at the
% last point, while moving towards each intermediate point in turn.
%
% Also, notice the pattern of the coefficients of the polynomials in these 
% three examples. 
%
% * Order 1 - [1 1]
% * Order 2 - [1 2 1]
% * Order 3 - [1 3 3 1]
%
% Do you recognize them? They're our old friends the
% <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient binomial
% coefficients>. You can follow this pattern and create higher order 
% BÃ©zier curves with more points.

%%
% So why do computer graphics programmers love BÃ©zier curves? Because they 
% have a lot of useful properties. They're based on those simple polynomials, 
% and we know how to do all sorts of things with polynomials like that. 
%
% For example, we can calculate the first derivative with respect to $t$.

a = -3*t.^2 +  6*t - 3;
b =  9*t.^2 - 12*t + 3;
c = -9*t.^2 +  6*t;
d =  3*t.^2;

tvec = kron(a,pt1) + kron(b,pt2) + kron(c,pt3) + kron(d,pt4);

%%
% This gives us the tangent vector at any point on the curve. We can these
% to our plot with hold on, but we won't draw all of them because it gets
% too crowded.
for i=1:10:101
    l = line([pts(1,i), pts(1,i)+tvec(1,i)/6], ... 
             [pts(2,i), pts(2,i)+tvec(2,i)/6]);
    l.Color = 'green';
end

%%
% If you look at the values of those derivatives, you'll see an interesting
% pattern. When $t$ equals 0, the four terms are [-3, 3, 0, 0]. That means 
% that the tangent of the start of the curve is simply $3pt_2 - 3pt_1$. The
% same thing happens at the other end when $t$ equals 1. 
%
% This makes it easy to connect two BÃ©zier curves so that they tangent at 
% the meeting point. You just make the last two points of the first curve 
% colinear with the first two points of the second curve.

% Notice that $pt3$, $pt4$, and $pt5$ are colinear:
pt4 - pt3
pt5 - pt4

% And if we plot the curves, we can see that we get a nice, smooth join 
% where they meet.

% page>.
%
% The teapot is actually made of BÃ©zier patches. These are parametric surfaces 
% which are made from the same math as BÃ©zier curves, but with two
% parameters (usually called $u$ and $v$) instead of the one parameter (i.e. $t$)
% that we've been using here. We'll come back to investigate BÃ©zier patches
% in a future post, but first we're going to explore how to draw some other
% useful curves.
